# ASF DOGGOS

## Introduction

A list of dogs retrieved from Petfinder API used to dynamically display dogs on ASF's website (possibly). When a dogs picture is clicked, then the app will show a profile page that contains more information/photos about dog. This is a very basic feature and can simplify a potential adopters search for their new pet since the alternatives are keeping up with sporadic petfinder and facebook postings.
